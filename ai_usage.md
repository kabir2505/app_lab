# AI Usage Declaration — Event Management System

This section documents the level of AI assistance used throughout the development of the project, following the **AI Usage Quantification Guidelines for App Dev Lab**.

All calculations follow the official weightage table provided for **Frontend (40%)**, **Backend (50%)**, and **Infrastructure (10%)**.

# AI Usage Breakdown

Below is the list of components where AI assistance was used, along with the percentage contribution computed as per guidelines.

---

## **Frontend (React – 40%)**

### **1. Components (10% weight)**  
AI involvement: `10% × 0.7 = 7%`

**AI contribution:** Helped structure reusable components and styling patterns.

**Final Contribution:** **7%**

---

### **2. Pages (15% weight)**  
AI involvement: `15% × 0.8 = 12%`

**AI contribution:** Provided scaffolding for UI pages and form structures.

**Final Contribution:** **12%**

---

## **Backend (Express + TypeORM – 50%)**

### **3. Controllers (15% weight)**  
AI involvement: `15% × 0.2 = 3%`

**AI contribution:** Assisted in refining request handlers and validation patterns.

**Final Contribution:** **3%**

---

### **4. Services (10% weight)**  
AI involvement:`10% × 0.2 = 2%`

**AI contribution:** Helped shape some business logic and database operations.

**Final Contribution:** **2%**

# **Total AI Usage Calculation**

| Component      | Weight | AI % Used | Final Contribution |
|----------------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Components     | 10%    | 70%       | **7%**             |
| Pages          | 15%    | 80%       | **12%**            |
| Controllers    | 15%    | 20%       | **3%**             |
| Services       | 10%    | 20%       | **2%**             |

### **Total AI Usage = 7% + 12% + 3% + 2% = 24%**

This stays within the recommended threshold (≤ 30%).

#  Declaration

I acknowledge that AI tools (ChatGPT) were used to support development in the above components.  
The **overall estimated AI involvement is 24%** of the project work.  
All core logic, debugging, architectural decisions, and implementation details were designed and written by me.
